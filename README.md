This repository is meant to serve as a stripped-down example of how you can
combine ``sphinx`` for generating documentation, ``pytest`` for testing, and
GitHub's Travis CI for automating both processes.

The documentation for this project is hosted
[here on GitHub pages](https://jennirinker.github.io/code-for-the-world).

The project was developed as part of the 2018 
[Advanced Scientific Programming in Python](https://python.g-node.org/wiki/)
summer school and presented in Canberra in 2019.
